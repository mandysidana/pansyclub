## Who is a 'Pansy'?

At Pansy Club, we embrace the term 'pansy' as a badge of creativity, curiosity, and community spirit. A pansy is someone who:

- Loves making crafts for the joy of creating
- Finds fun and fulfillment in hands-on projects
- Challenges consumerism and celebrates handmade, sustainable alternatives
- Seeks connection, collaboration, and belonging in a supportive community

We believe that crafting is for everyoneâ€”regardless of background, skill level, or identity. Pansy Club is a welcoming space where you can express yourself, learn new skills, and make meaningful connections with others who share your passion for creativity.

Pansy Club is a community-based arts and crafts studio where creativity thrives. Our mission is to bring people together to explore, learn, and share the joy of crafting. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced artist, you are welcome to join our workshops, events, and vibrant community.
